# xLSTM in Easy Pytorch

This repo contains the _unofficial_ implementation of `xLSTM` model as introduced in [Beck et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04517). This repo is developed mainly for didactic purposes to spell out the details of a `Long-Short Term Memory` with competitive performances against modern `Transformers` or `State-Space` models (e.g. `Mamba`).
